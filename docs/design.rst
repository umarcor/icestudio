Resize text blocks
``````````````````

**Memory**, **Code**, and **Information** blocks can be resized with the resize tool in the **bottom-right corner** of the block.

Block examination
`````````````````

Non-basic blocks can be examined by **double clicking** the block using the **mouse left button**. This is a recursive action. A navigation menu is shown on the bottom left corner, to easily jump back/up in the design. Pan, zoom and code browsing are enabled during navigation. *Edit > Fit content* is also supported. However, other menus are disabled.
